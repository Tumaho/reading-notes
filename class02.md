- H2 is used for subheadings and it cames with a small size comparing with h1.
- If there are further sections under the subheadings then the H3 element is used, and Etc.

## Paragraphs 

### its a container of texts, each paragraph cames in a new line and we can create it by this tag '<p>some text</p>'

## Superscript & Subscript

- superscript : used to contain characters that should be superscript such as raising a number to a power such as 2^2.

- subscript : used to contain characters that should be subscript such as chemical formulas such as H20.

## some other tags that help us in text :

- Line Break : to make a new line.

- Horizontal : make a line between two paragraphs.

- Strong : to make a text **bold**

- Emphasis : to make a text *italic*

- Etc ..

# CSS

## What is CSS?

### Stands for Cascading Style Sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages. They can be used to define text styles, table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously could only be defined in a page's HTML.CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration. div {declaration };   the div is a selector.

### the declaration have two parts : value and Property 

- color : Red; the color is Property and the Red is value.

## Types of CSS 

1- Internal : Write the CSS code inside the html head.

2- External : write the CSS code in CSS file not in html.

3- Inline : write the CSS code inline with html elements its mean inside the body.

## Inheritance in CSS

### We can inherete some properties in sub elements from super element, meaning that anything inside the body can inherete the same value of body.

# Basic JS Statement 

## Statement 

### A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 

## Variables
