# Layout in HTML

### blocks

#### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.

### Containing Elements

#### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.

### Floating elements

#### The float property allows you to take an element in normal flow and place it as far to the left or right of the containing element as possible.

### Screen Sizes

#### Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.

### Screen Resolution

#### Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
