## Boxes in HTML & CSS

#### All HTML elements can be considered as boxes. In CSS, the term "box model" is used when talking about design and layout. The CSS box model is essentially a box that wraps around every HTML element. It consists of: margins, borders, padding, and the actual content.

### Every box has three available properties:

1- Border : Every box has a border. The border separates the edge of one box from another.

2- Margin : Margins sit outside the edge of the border.

3- Padding : Padding is the space between the border of a box and any content contained within it.

#### IF statement no need to provide an else option, but switch statement have a default option that is run if none of the cases match.
