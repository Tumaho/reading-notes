# Images in HTML

### To add an image into the page you need to use an <img> element. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes: SRC and ALT for example :

- `<img src="images/quokka.jpg" alt="A family of quokka" title="The quokka is an Australian  marsupial that is similar in size to the  domestic cat." />`

### The `<img>` also have a height and width to edit it.

### There are three rules to creat an image:

1- Save images in the right format.

2- Save images at the right size.

3- Use the correct resolution.

### About image dimensions we can do:

- Reducing image size.

- Increasing image size.

- Changing chape.

- Cropping image.

## Image resolution

#### Images created for the web should be saved at a resolution of 72 ppi. The higher the resolution of the image, the larger the size of the file.

## Vector images

#### Vector images differ from bitmap images and are resolution-independent. Vector images are commonly created in programs such as Adobe Illustrator.

## Animated GIF

#### Animated GIFs show several frames of an image in sequence and therefore can be used to create simple animations.
