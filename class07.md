## Tables

### A table represents information in a grid format. Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.

### The `<table>` element is used to create a table. The contents of the table are written out row by row.

### Tables Heading

- The `<th>` element is used just like the `<td>` element but its purpose is to represent the heading for either a column or a row. (The th stands for table heading.) 

### Long Tables

- There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows:

1- `<thead>`

2- `<tbody>`

3- `<tfoot>`

## WAYS TO CREATE OBJECTS

### CREATE THE OBJECT, THEN ADD PROPERTIES & METHODS IN TWO WAYS:

1- Literal notation

2- Constructor notation

## THIS (IT IS A KEYWORD) 

### The keyword this is commonly used inside functions and objects. Where the function is declared alters what this means. It always refers to one object, usually the object in which the function operates. 

## GLOBAL OBJECTS: STRING OBJECT 


### Whenever you have a value that is a string, you can use the properties and methods of the String object on that value.

## GLOBAL OBJECTS: NUMBER OBJECT

### Whenever you have a value that is a number, you can use the methods and properties of the Number object on it. 

## GLOBAL OBJECTS: DATE OBJECT

### Once you have created a Date object, the following methods let you set and retrieve the time and date that it represents.
