# Forms

### HTML form on a web page allows a user to enter data that is sent to a server for processing. Forms can resemble paper or database forms because web users fill out the forms using checkboxes, radio buttons, or text fields. For example, forms can be used to enter shipping or credit card data to order a product, or can be used to retrieve search results from a search engine.

#### Form controls live inside a `<form>` element. This element should always carry the actionattribute and will usually have a method and id attribute too.

# Events

### When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

### When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code. Together these steps are known as event handling. 

1- Select t he element node(s) you want the script to respond to. 

2- Indicate which event on the selected node(s) will trigger the response. 

3- State the code you want to run when the event occurs. 

## Events Lisetener

### Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events. They can deal with more than one function at a time but they are not supported in older browsers.
