## CSS

### Images

* A picture can say a thousand words, and great images help make the difference between an average-looking site and a really engaging one.

* There are many reasons why you might want to add an image to a web page: you might want to include a logo, photograph, illustration, diagram, or chart.

* When adding an image to the website it's good to keep in mind the following:
  * Is it relevant?!
  * Does it convey helpful information?!
  * Is it fit for the mood the website is creating?!
  * Will your audience be able to recognize it on the go?!
  * Does it fit the color pallet and the general theme of the website?!

* It's possible to control the **size** of an image using the **width** and **height** properties in CSS, just like you can for any other box. 

* If you want to **overlay** text on a **background image**, the image must be **low contrast** in order for the text to be legible.

* To overlay text on an image with **high contrast**, you can use image editing applications such as Photoshop and GIMP which have tools that allow you to manually adjust your images to have lower contrast. Or place a semi-transparent background color (or "screen") behind the text to improve legibility.


* There are three rules to remember when you are creating images for your website:
  1. Save Images In the right format: Websites mainly use images in **jpeg**, **gif**, or **png** format. *If you choose the wrong image format* then your image might not look as sharp as it should and can make the web page slower to load.
  
  2. Save images at the right size:  If the image is **smaller** than the **width or height** that you have **specified** for the website, the image can be **distorted** and **stretched**. On the other hand If the image is **larger** than the **width** and **height** you have specified, the image **will take longer** time to display on the page.

  3. Use the correct resolution: Saving images at a **higher resolution** results in images that are **larger** than necessary and take **longer to download**.

* When cropping images it is *important not to lose valuable information*. It is best to source images that are the correct shape if possible.


### Practical Information

* Search engine optimization (or **SEO**) is the practice of trying to help your site appear nearer the top of search engine results when people look for the topics that your website covers.

* Search engines rely very heavily on the text that is in your pages so it is important that the terms people are going to search for are in text.

* Ensuring that any images have appropriate text in the value of their `alt` attribute also helps search engines understand the content of images.

* Getting other sites to **link** to you is just as important as on-page techniques. Search engines help determine how to rank your site by looking at the number of other sites that link to yours.

* They are particularly interested in sites **whose content is related to yours**. For example, if you were running a website that sold fish bait, then a link from a hairdresser is **not** likely to be **considered** as **relevant** as one from an angling community.

* Search engines also look at the **words between** the opening `<a>` tag and closing `</a>` tag in the link. If the text in the link contains **keywords** (rather than just click here or your website address) it may be considered **more relevant**.

* In every page of your website there are **seven key places** where keywords (the words people might search on to find your site) can appear **in order to improve its findability**.

  1. Page title: It is specified in the `<title>` element which lives inside the `<head>` element.

  2. URL / Web address: The **name** of the **file** is part of the URL. Where possible, **use keywords** in the file name.

  3. Headings: If the **keywords** are in a heading `<hn>` element then a search engine will know that this page is all about that subject and **give it greater weight than other text**.

  4. Text: Where possible, it helps to **repeat the keywords** in the main body of the **text** at least **2-3 times**. **Do not**, however, **over-use these terms**, because the text must be easy for a human to read.

  5. link text: Use keywords in the text that create links between pages (rather than using generic expressions such as "click here").

  6. Image alt text: Search engines rely on you **providing accurate descriptions** of images in the **alt text**. This will also help your images show up in the results of image-based searches.

  7.  Page descriptions: The **description** also **lives** inside the `<head>` element and is specified using a `<meta>` tag. It should be a sentence that **describes the content of the page**. (These are not shown in the browser window but they may be displayed in the results pages of search engines.)

* There are several **tools** that let you enter your keywords and then they will suggest additional keywords you might like to consider, such as: **adwords.google.co.uk/ select/KeywordToolExternal**

* As soon as people start **coming to your site**, you can start **analyzing** **how** they found it, **what** they were looking at and **at what** point they are leaving. One of the best tools for doing this is a free service offered by Google called **Google Analytics**.

* In order to put your site on the web you will need a domain name and web hosting. Your domain name is your web address (e.g. google.com or bbc. co.uk). And web hosting is basically used to let people see your website on the internet, Web servers are special computers that are constantly connected to the Internet. They are specially set up to serve web pages when they are requested.

* To transfer your code and images from your computer to your hosting company, you use something known as File Transfer Protocol.
